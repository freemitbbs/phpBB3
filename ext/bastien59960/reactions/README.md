# Bastien59960 Reactions - phpBB 3.3+ Extension

[Français](README.fr.md)

**Add modern, high-signal community feedback to every post.**

As forum content written by real users becomes more valuable, engagement quality matters more than vanity metrics. Bastien59960 Reactions gives phpBB administrators a robust emoji reaction system with live UX, notification controls, digest emails, and unsubscribe-safe delivery flows.

## Why install it

- Increase member engagement with lightweight feedback on every post.
- Keep notifications useful with anti-spam digest timing and per-user preferences.
- Provide a smooth AJAX experience without full page reloads.
- Keep operational control from ACP with configurable limits and picker behavior.

## Key features

### Reactions UX and live sync

- Emoji reactions under posts with counters and user tooltips.
- AJAX add/remove endpoints for fast interaction.
- Configurable background sync interval for near-real-time updates.
- Configurable picker behavior (size, categories, search, full emoji set loading).

### Notifications and digest cron

- In-forum notifications for new reactions.
- Email digest cron task grouping reactions by recipient and by post.
- Anti-spam delay between digests (ACP setting).
- Run-time safeguards: processing window and per-run cap.

### Unsubscribe handling for digest emails

- Signed unsubscribe link in reaction digest emails.
- `GET /app.php/reactions/unsubscribe` endpoint validates token and updates user preference.
- Outcome-aware HTTP responses (`200`, `403`, `404`) and user messaging.
- Optional integration with AdminHelper log table (`unsubscribe_type = reactions_notify`) when available.

### ACP and UCP controls

- ACP settings for limits and display behavior:
  - max reaction types per post
  - max reactions per user per post
  - digest delay
  - picker and display parameters
- UCP preference support for email digest opt-in/out.

### Data hygiene

- Cleans up orphan/self-reaction notification candidates during cron processing.
- Marks handled reaction items to avoid repeated notifications.

## Requirements

- PHP `>= 7.4.0`
- phpBB `>= 3.3.0`
- MySQL/MariaDB with `utf8mb4` recommended for full emoji coverage

## Stored data (summary)

Main storage points:

- `post_reactions` table: reaction events, emojis, timestamps, and digest handling flags.
- `users.user_reactions_cron_email`: member digest email preference.
- phpBB notifications tables for in-forum and email notification methods.

## Security and privacy

- CSRF protections and permission checks apply to reaction actions.
- Unsubscribe token uses HMAC signature derived from forum secret material.
- Digest unsubscribe endpoint updates only reaction email preference.
- No API keys or server secrets are stored in extension files.

## Known limits

- Full emoji fidelity depends on `utf8mb4` database configuration.
- Email delivery timing depends on phpBB queue and cron regularity.
- AdminHelper log integration is conditional on AdminHelper log table availability.
